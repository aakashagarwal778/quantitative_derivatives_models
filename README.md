# quantitative_derivatives_models
A repository housing a collection of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and other code artifacts related to the modeling and analysis of derivative instruments using quantitative methods. This repository serves as a resource for researchers, students, and practitioners interested in exploring and implementing various derivative pricing models, risk management techniques, and quantitative strategies.

The repository covers a wide range of topics within the field of quantitative finance, including but not limited to:

1. Implementation of popular derivative pricing models such as Black-Scholes, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein (CRR), and Heston models.
2. Monte Carlo simulation methods for pricing and risk analysis of derivatives.
3. Numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in derivative pricing.
4. Sensitivity analysis and hedging strategies for managing derivative portfolio risk.
5. Machine learning approaches for derivative pricing and risk management.
6. Backtesting and validation of derivative pricing models using historical data.

The repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning resource for individuals interested in mastering the quantitative aspects of derivative modeling and analysis through a combination of theoretical discussions, practical examples, and code implementations.
